# 🔆LPRS™ Live Proxy Relay Server

The 🔆<b>LPRS™ Live Proxy Relay Server</b> (Live Proxy Relay Server) is a powerful, low-latency media gateway and proxy server engineered to meet the rigorous demands of professional television and broadcast operations, utilizing cutting-edge transport protocols.

🔆<b>LPRS™</b> is built to eliminate the complexity and cost traditionally associated with multi-protocol, high-quality stream distribution.

✅ <b>Protocol Agnostic Native Support</b>: Natively supports all essential modern protocols: <b>SRT</b> / <b>RIST</b> / <b>RTMP</b> / <b>RTMPS</b> / <b>HLS</b> / <b>WebRTC</b> / <b>RTSP</b>. Functions as a true agnostic, real-time, multi-format, multi-standard media relay server, supporting any audio/video/data format WITHOUT requiring proprietary hardware or software modifications to your existing infrastructure.

✅ <b>Scalable & High-Quality Distribution</b>: Simultaneous Multi-Stream Transport: Capable of transporting multiple independent audio-video streams concurrently. One-to-Many HD/UHD/4K: Efficiently distributes a single HD, UHD, or 4K source stream to 'N' simultaneous receivers. Zero-Loss Quality Assurance (NO Transcoding): Achieves transparent multiplication and distribution of the signal to 'N' users at the highest available source quality, entirely eliminating quality degradation associated with transcoding.

✅ <b>Operational Control & Security</b>: Advanced Stream Management: Provides granular control and monitoring over all received streams and connected users. Broadcast-Grade Security: Ensures content protection during transport via robust AES Encryption.

✅ <b>Production Workflow Enhancement</b>: Generalized Acquisition & Exchange: Significantly expands production possibilities by standardizing the reliable acquisition and exchange of live TV productions using ubiquitous SRT/RIST/RTMP/RTMPS/RTSP streams over public internet. Proven Reliability & Value: Application fully tested and validated in demanding broadcast environments, offering powerful capabilities at an UNBEATABLE cost profile.
